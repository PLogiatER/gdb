   ## Stack Frame Layout:                                

   This shows the layout of the stack frame for the general case of a
   function call; a given function might not have a variable number of
   arguments or local variables, or might not save any registers, so it would
   not have the corresponding frame areas.  Additionally, a leaf function
   (i.e. one which calls no other functions) does not need to save the
   contents of the BLINK register (which holds its return address), and a
   function might not have a frame pointer.
                                                                               
   @note The stack grows downward, so SP points below FP in memory; SP always
         points to the last used word on the stack, not the first one.

   The list of arguments to be passed to a function is considered to be a
   sequence of _N_ words (as though all the parameters were stored in order in
   memory with each parameter occupying an integral number of words).  Words
   1..8 are passed in registers 0..7; if the function has more than 8 words of
   arguments then words 9..@em N are passed on the stack in the caller's frame.
                                                                               
   If the function has a variable number of arguments, e.g. it has a form such
   as

      function(p1, p2, ...);
                                                                               
   and _P_ words are required to hold the values of the named parameters
   (which are passed in registers 0..@em P -1), then the remaining 8 - _P_
   words passed in registers _P_..7 are spilled into the top of the frame so
   that the anonymous parameter words occupy a continous region.
                                                                               
   ## Build Configuration:

   The ARC gdb may be built in two different configurations, according to 
   the nature of the target that it is to debug:                          
                                                                               
   arc-tdep.[ch] provides operations which are common to both configurations.
   Operations which are specific to one, or which have different variants in
   each configuration, are provided by the other files.

   ### arc-elf32-gdb

    The frame info changes by changing the decrementing the delta_sp and

    not be a leaf!); also the offset of the blink register save location from
    the previous value of sp is recorded.  This will eventually used to
    compute the address of the save location:

      <blink saved address> = <prev sp> + <blink offset from prev sp>

    The addition (+=) below is because the sp offset and the instruction
    offset are negative - so incrementing the sp offset by the instruction
    offset is actually making the sp offset more negative, correctly
    reflecting that SP is moving further down the downwards-growing stack.

    Returns: the address of the first instruction after the prologue.

    This function is called by our unwinder as well as from
    arc_skip_prologue () in the case that it cannot detect the end of the
    prologue.

    'this_frame' and 'info' are NULL if this function is called from
    arc_skip_prologue in an attempt to discover the end of the prologue.  In
    this case we don't fill in the 'info' structure that is passed in.

    @todo.
       1. Support 32 bit normal frames generated by GCC 2.95
       2. Support 16 and 32 bit mixed frames generated by GCC 2.95
       3. Support 32 bit normal variadic function frames by GCC 2.95
       4. Support 32 bit normal frames from GCC 3.4.x with variadic args
       5. Support 16 and 32 bit normal frames from GCC 3.4.x with variadic args
       6. Support 16 and 32 bit mixed frames generated by GCC 3.4.x
       7. Support Metaware generated prologues
            (The difference is in the use of thunks to identify the saving and
             restoring of callee saves: may have to do some hackery even in
             next_pc, since the call is going to create its own set of problems
             with our stack setup).

    We attempt to use the disassembler interface from the opcodes library to do
    our disassembling.

    The usual 32 bit normal gcc -O0 prologue looks like this:

    Complete Prologue for all GCC frames (Cases #1 to #6 in TODOs above):

       sub  sp, sp, limm         ; space for variadic arguments
       st.a blink, [sp,-4]       ; push blink (if not a leaf function)
                                 ; - decrements sp
       sub  sp, sp , limm        ; (optional space creation for callee saves)
       st   r13, [sp]            ; push of first callee saved register
       st   r14, [sp,4]          ; push of next callee saved register
       ...
       st.a fp , [sp,-4]         ; push fp (if fp has to be saved)
                                 ; - decrements sp
       mov  fp , sp              ; set the current frame up correctly
       sub  sp , sp , #immediate ; create space for local vars on the stack

/*! Return the virtual frame pointer.

   GDB and the GNU tool chain is increasingly vague about the use of a "frame
   pointer" (FP). With the ARC tool GCC, the FP (r2) is used to point to the
   middle of the current stack frame, just below the saved FP and before local
   variables, register spill area and outgoing args.  However for optimization
   levels above O2 and in any case in leaf functions, the frame pointer is
   usually not set at all. The exception being when handling nested functions.

   We use this function to return a "virtual" frame pointer, marking the start
   of the current stack frame as a register-offset pair.  If the FP is not
   being used, then it should return SP, with an offset of the frame size.

   The current implementation doesn't actually know the frame size, nor
   whether the FP is actually being used, so for now we just return SP and an
   offset of zero. This is no worse than other architectures, but is needed to
   avoid assertion failures.

   @todo Can we determine the frame size to get a correct offset?

   @param[in]  gdbarch     The GDB architecture being used.
   @param[in]  pc          Program counter where we need the virtual FP.
   @param[out] reg_ptr     The base register used for the virtual FP.
   @param[out] offset_ptr  The offset used for the virtual FP.                */
